# HW3: Visualization Dashboard: Interactivity

# Comments
For homework 3 my implementation includes two Interaction Techniques accompanied with a transition.

The first interaction appears in the scatterplot where you can pan and zoom within the scatterplot.

The second interaction appears in the bar graph, there is a button at the bottom right of the screen that acts as selection and selects the top 5 bars on the graph, and then uses transition animations to expand them out to fill in the gaps left over by the rest of the bars. (Couldn't figure out how to relabel the x-axis effectively, so for purpose of assignment i added temporary lables in the middle of the graph at each of the 5 bars)
